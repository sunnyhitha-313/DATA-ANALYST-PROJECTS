**Business Objective**

This project examines Instagram user data to analyze engagement behavior, detect high-performing creators, and generate data-driven marketing strategies to enhance retention, interaction, and long-term platform growth.

**Dataset Overview**

The analysis utilizes seven interconnected relational tables — Users, Photos, Likes, Comments, Follows, Tags, and Photo_Tags — allowing comprehensive evaluation of user behavior, content performance, and social connectivity patterns.

**User Activity & Engagement Analysis**

User engagement was assessed by measuring total uploads, likes, comments, and interaction per post. The findings indicate that engagement is driven by a small segment of active creators, while approximately one-quarter of users remain inactive, highlighting a clear opportunity for re-engagement initiatives.

**Content & Hashtag Insights**

Hashtag evaluation revealed that emotionally expressive and lifestyle-oriented tags consistently outperform generic tags in terms of engagement. Content centered around positive experiences and relatable themes attracts stronger audience interaction.

**Posting Consistency & Engagement Relationship**

The study identified a positive correlation between posting frequency and total engagement. Users who publish content consistently experience higher interaction levels, demonstrating that regular content creation strengthens audience reach and visibility.

**User Segmentation & Influencer Discovery**

Users were categorized into behavioral segments such as High-Value Creators, Emerging Users, and Inactive Users based on activity and engagement efficiency. Engagement per post proved to be a more reliable performance indicator than follower count when identifying influencer potential.

🎯 **Business Objective**

This project establishes a SQL-driven analytical framework that supports segmentation-based marketing, influencer selection strategies, reactivation campaigns, and performance-focused growth optimization for scalable digital platforms.
